# Action - `post`

## Description

The intent of the `post` action is to send a message to listening parties.  It does not store anything on chain; its consumption depends on third-party tools.

By setting the `certify` parameter to a non-zero value, I, {{ account }} certify that the contents of the `title`, `content` and `json_metadata` fields are true, under penalty of perjury.
