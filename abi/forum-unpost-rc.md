# Action - `unpost`

## Description

The intent of the `unpost` action is to suggest that a previously posted message (through the `post` action), as referred by `post_uuid`, be removed by the different front-ends reading this contract's transaction flow.

I, {{ poster }} understand that this action will not remove the message from circulation, as it will be imprinted in the blockchain.  I also understand that some front-ends might not remove the message, and even highlight the fact that a message was intended to be removed, potentially attracting attention on an undesired message.
