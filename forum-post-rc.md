# Action - `post`

## Description

The intent of the `post` action is to send a message to listening parties.  It does not store anything on chain; its consumption depends on third-party tools.

By setting the `certify` parameter to a non-zero value, I, {{account}} certify that the contents of the `title` and `content` fields are true, under penalty of perjury.
